# Intro_DL_Image_Classification
starts at 2 pm Nov. 26, Tuesday 

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning algorithms that is good at recognizing patterns. Recent advances in deep learning made tasks such as image and speech recognition possible. This workshop will demonstrate how to develop neural network models from scratch for image classification.

Objectives: During the workshop participants will be able to:

Understand the major trends driving the rise of deep learning and where and how it is applied today.
Set up a machine learning problem with a neural network mindset.
Build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and back-propagation.
Understand the key computations underlying deep learning, use them to build and train convolutional neural networks, and apply it to image classification.
Level: Introductory

Duration: 3 hours
